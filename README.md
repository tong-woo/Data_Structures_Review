# Studying_Data_Structures
**updated Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday everyweek**

A learning note and code realization based on python including Linear Data Structures, Hash Maps, Algorithmic Concepts, Nonlinear Data Structures,
Sorting Algorithms, Graphs and Graph Traversals etc.

I will update this in detail with explanation in the next steps... 
## Linear Data Structures

- Linked lists
- Doubly LInked lists
- Searching Arrays
- Queues
- Stacks

## Hash maps
- what is Hash maps
- Hash function
- Hash map underlying data structure
- hash map only one value: Each Hash Map key can be paired with only one value. However, different keys can be paired with the same value.# Data_Structures_Review
