/**
 * base case and recursive step is important
 * Problem Type: problems that require the execution of an action multiple times until
 * a condition is met. For many problems, a recursive solution will result in fewer lines
 * of code and will be easier to comprehend than a solution that uses a for or while loop.
 *
 *
 * Recursion includes calling the function itself in the function
 *
 * Iteration is a repetition of a block of code
 *
 *
 * start by thinking about potential recursive and base cases for your solution.
